        Cubes appear in the same spot with the same orientation every time.

    Position Randomization
        .. image:: /_static/env_images/stack_two_blocks_p.png
            :height: 200
        Position of each cube will vary by up to 0.1m in the X-direction and up to 0.25m in the Y-direction.

    Orientation Randomization
        .. image:: /_static/env_images/stack_two_blocks_o.png
            :height: 200
        Orientation of each cube will vary by up to 180 degrees in either direction about the Z-axis.

    Position and Orientation Randomization
        .. image:: /_static/env_images/stack_two_blocks_p_o.png
            :height: 200
        Position and orientation will both vary as specified above.
